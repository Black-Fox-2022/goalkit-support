**AI Integrations**
We are actively exploring various AI (artificial intelligence) functionalities within our app. To facilitate this, we leverage OpenAI to access ChatGPT. When a request is initiated, essential data is transmitted to OpenAI's servers to generate a response. It's important to note that all AI features are exclusively activated upon your explicit request, and they are distinctly identified with an "AI" symbol. When you opt for any AI-supported feature, the name(s) of the goal(s) will be transmitted to OpenAI's servers for processing. Your privacy and control over AI interactions remain paramount, and we only engage AI functionalities when you choose to do so. We reserve the right to modify or remove features in the future based on their utility, please be aware of that.
